This is my responsive personal website built with HTML, CSS and Javascript, hosted on github pages. It includes a link to two other projects:
- Online retro game arcade I created with HTML5 Canvas, CSS and ES6 Javascript game mechanics.
- Piano digital education book (prototype) with my own coded SVG illustrations throughout e.g. piano keys, musical scores. HTML, CSS, Javascript.
