# unwontedsponn.github.io / benspooner.co.uk

This is my responsive personal website built with HTML, CSS and Javascript, hosted on github pages. It includes links to two other projects:
- Online retro game arcade, created with HTML5 Canvas, CSS and ES6 Javascript game mechanics.
- Piano digital education book (prototype), created with HTML, CSS and Javascript, and my own coded SVG illustrations throughout e.g. piano keys, musical scores.
