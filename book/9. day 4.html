				Major key chords
			</h1>

			<p class="font-size-body-text"><span class="bold">Three common chords</span><br>
			You’ve probably already noticed how some
			groups of notes sound great together, while
			others just don’t. Here’s why... There are
			relationships between notes. Some notes are
			well-matched, some are unstable. The quicker
			you get to know which ones make beautiful
			music together, you’ll do just that. All music,
			from nursery rhymes to complex jazz, can be
			boiled down to three common groups of notes
			we call chords. To be even more precise they
			are triad chords, reflecting the fact they are
			made up of three notes.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Major chords: Sound happy.<br>Minor chords: Sad.<br>Diminished chords: Dark and edgy.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">All that’s needed to play these chords is a
			simple formula.</p>

			<table class="main-table">
				<thead class="orange">
					<tr>
						<th colspan="3">THREE COMMON CHORDS</th>

					<tr>

			</table>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Cover the table and say the three formulas
			back to yourself. This is another one of those
			instructions that’s easy to gloss over. Don’t!</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Now make a C major chord using the
			R, 4, 3 formula:</p>

			<table class="invisible_table">
				<tr>
					<td></td>

					<td></td>
					<td>C</td>
					<td>E</td>
					<td>G</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td>R</td>
					<td>4</td>
					<td>3</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Turn it into a C minor chord, noticing how the
			E simply moves down a semitone:</p>

			<table class="invisible_table">
				<tr>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td>C</td>
					<td class="bold">Eb</td>
					<td>G</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td>R</td>
					<td>3</td>
					<td>4</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Finally, the C diminished chord. This time the
			G moves down one semitone:</p>

			<table class="invisible_table">
				<tr>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td>C</td>
					<td class="bold">Eb</td>
					<td class="bold">Gb</td>
					<td></td>

				</tr>
				<tr>

					<td>R</td>
					<td>3</td>
					<td>3</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">See how only one note changes as you progress
			from major, to minor, to diminished. Whatever
			your root note, this is always the case. The shape
			your hand makes feels slightly different for
			different major, minor and diminished chords
			(so you can hit the black notes required) but the
			fact is all major, minor and diminished chords are
			constructed using the same formula - a formula
			that only changes by one note each time.</p>

			<div class="pop_up_box"><span class="bold">Root skip skip</span><br>
				<p class="font-size-body-text">Notice how the C minor chord is written
				as C, <span class="bold">Eb</span>, G. Not C, <span class="bold">D#</span>, G even though Eb
				and D# are enharmonic equivalents of
				each other. It’s easy to work out which
				alphabetical name to choose when you
				know how. The trick is to write your root
				note, skip a letter, write the next letter,
				skip, write. Like this:</p>

				<table class="invisible_table_2">

			<p class="font-size-body-text">When you play chords in really low registers
			they often sound muddy, like a noise rather than something more harmonious. In the
			higher registers chords can sound too shrill.
			Take a moment to experiment and find
			registers that sound satisfying. Use either
			hand. Both hands perhaps.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text"><span class="bold">Time to choose: </span>Select a root note and create
			its major chord, then its minor chord, then its
			diminished chord. Then reverse back through
			the minor, ending on the major. Repeat this a few
			times to learn the three forms of several chords.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">How many major chords are there? There are
			twelve in total, one for each note of the piano.
			How many C major chords can you find? How
			many F# major chords can you find? How many
			minor chords do you think there are? Again, there
			are twelve in total. Getting to know your chords is
			a crucial step in developing your piano playing.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text"><span class="bold">The chords of major keys</span><br>
			When you’re playing in a key, like you’re going to
			for your composition, you need to know which
			chords belong to that key. Not all chords belong
			to every key. Here’s how to work out which
			chords belong. Play the major scale of the key
			you’ve decided on for your composition. For
			each note there is a corresponding chord.
			These are the chords that belong to your key:</p>

			<table class="invisible_table">
				<tr>
					<td>R</td>
					<td>T</td>
					<td>T</td>
					<td>S</td>
					<td>T</td>
					<td>T</td>

				<tr class="bold">
					<td>MAJ</td>
					<td>min</td>
					<td>min</td>
					<td>MAJ</td>
					<td>MAJ</td>
					<td>min</td>
					<td>dim</td>
					<td>MAJ</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Notice UPPERCASE is used for major chords and
			lower case for minor. It’s a useful convention to
			help you take in the chord type more quickly. So
			is using roman numerals:</p>

			<table class="invisible_table">
				<tr>
					<td>MAJ</td>
					<td>min</td>
					<td>min</td>
					<td>MAJ</td>
					<td>MAJ</td>
					<td>min</td>
					<td>dim</td>
					<td>MAJ</td>

				<tr class="bold">
					<td>I</td>
					<td>iim</td>
					<td>iiim</td>
					<td>IV</td>
					<td>V</td>
					<td>vim</td>
					<td>viio</td>
					<td>I</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">UPPERCASE roman numerals are for major
			chords. Lowercase for minor, with a small m. A
			small o indicates that the chord is diminished.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Example: C major chords</p>

			<table class="invisible_table">

				</tr>
			</table>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Add the lowercase m’s and a small o to the notes
			of your major key table on your worksheet. This
			transforms the notes into the correct chords that
			belong to your key. Use the bottom row to help you.</p>
