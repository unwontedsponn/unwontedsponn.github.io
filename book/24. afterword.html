			<p class="font-size-body-text">After reading Beginner To Composer In 14 Days
			people often assume I’m against the more
			conventional forms of musical education, when
			in fact I teach and examine music grades, and
			I’m the first to wax lyrical about their value.
			I do however recognise their limitations. The
			purpose of the exam route is to promote steady
			progression in technical ability, performance
			and theoretical understanding. Improvisation
			seldom comes into it, with the exception of a
			few jazz syllabuses; but even then students
			commonly <em>memorise</em> an ‘improv’ in inverted
			commas way ahead of their exam. Composition
			never comes into it. It’s simply not what these
			regular kinds of exams are designed to do.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">For a student to receive a rounded musical
			education they can’t lean solely on doing
			grades. That would be like learning French,
			but only how to read and speak other people’s
			words. It’s an approach that renders you
			passive in the world, unable to construct a
			single sentence of your own and contribute
			something of your own experience. To me,
			that’s missing out. Music is a language, a
			medium to communicate and share a glimpse
			of what’s inside of us. What a shame to only be
			able to receive, when each of us has something
			beautiful and unique we could express.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">If that romantic notion doesn’t stir you then perhaps this will. Learning to improvise and compose will significantly improve your musical
			fluency. I define musical fluency as the ease
			and speed at which someone reads, writes and
			plays musical notation; their grasp of music as
			a language, with grammar-like structures and a
			syntax of its very own. It’s common sense that
			someone who writes as well as reads and plays,
			is going to have a deeper understanding of their
			instrument. One skill cross-pollinates the other,
			strengthening the whole.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">To close I’d like to recap my musings from the
			very start of this book: the vital importance
			of <em>curiosity</em> in learning and progressing in a
			field. I used to think it was just me that needed
			creative freedom in order to ‘stick at things’,
			a quirk of my personality (a hint of authority
			complex perhaps). Today, after more than a
			decade teaching students of all ages, levels and
			dispositions I can confidently say <em>we all</em> benefit
			from creative freedom. The evidence is clear,
			it’s the <em>personal</em>, specialised enquiry into music
			that stimulates one’s appetite for it. ‘How can
			my opening bar feel more like that film scene
			I love?’ ‘How can my improv sound a bit more
			like Anna?’ These are the idiosyncratic kinds
			of questions that exist outside of organised
			syllabuses. The questions that tempt students
			to sit a little longer at the keys, and to raise
			that most important of bars, the one they set
			for themselves.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">So there you have it. While Beginner To
			Composer In 14 Days is a lot of fun, it’s also
			the manifestation of a man on a mission. For
			students, I hope it empowers you not only
			to play the greats but to create something
			great too; and to begin a dialogue with your
			instrument, a supportive and revelatory
			conversation that will last a lifetime. For
			educators, I hope Beginner To Composer In 14
			Days becomes a trusted resource, something
			you can lean on to help you deliver a holistic,
			humanistic musical education. Whoever you
			are, I hope you’ve enjoyed hanging out. Thank
			you for jamming with me.</p>
