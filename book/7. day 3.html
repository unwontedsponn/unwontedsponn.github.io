			<h1><span class="chap_num">Day 3: Ground Control To Major Tom</span>
				Playing in a major key
			</h1>

			<p class="font-size-body-text"><span class="bold">Key</span><br>
			If you’ve ever watched live jazz music, then
			you’ve probably seen musicians conferring
			what key they’re going to play in before they
			start a new piece. ‘This one’s in the key of
			Bb’ you’ll hear, or ‘this one’s in Eb’. Think of
			keys as the ‘home’ of the piece. Each home
			features a particular group of notes that gives
			it its distinctive feel. A piece may wander
			off to incorporate other notes for a bit of
			variation, but the majority of the time is spent
			in the home key. Playing with the original
			group of notes that is. There are major keys
			and minor keys e.g the key of C major, the key
			of C minor. Compositions in major keys sound
			happy and bright. Compositions in a minor key
			sound sombre.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text"><span class="bold">Major keys</span><br>
			To work out the notes of a major key there is
			a simple formula:</p>

			<table class="invisible_table">
				<tr>
					<td>R</td>
					<td>T</td>
					<td>T</td>
					<td>S</td>
					<td>T</td>
					<td>T</td>
					<td>T</td>
					<td>S</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">As you know, R stands for root note. S stands
			for Semitone, the smallest distance between
			two notes (you learned about semitones
			on Day One). T is new. It stands for tone, a
			fractionally larger distance between two
			notes. The higher note is just two semitones
			away from the lower note. Alternatively,
			think of it as skipping a semitone.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Example: C major</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Here I have used the major key formula to find
			the notes of the C major key. A piece in the key
			of C major would be made of these notes most
			of the time.</p>

			<table class="invisible_table">
				<tr>
					<td>R</td>
					<td>T</td>
					<td>T</td>
					<td>S</td>
					<td>T</td>
					<td>T</td>
					<td>T</td>
					<td>S</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>C</td>
					<td>D</td>
					<td>E</td>
					<td>F</td>
					<td>G</td>
					<td>A</td>
					<td>B</td>
					<td>C</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Cover the major key formula and memorise it.
			Make sure you can say it aloud several times
			without looking before you continue.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text"><span class="bold">Major scales</span><br>
			When the notes of a major key are played in
			order we call it a major scale and the easiest
			way to play them is with finger patterns. When
			you see musicians playing at lightning speed,
			eyes closed, they’re relying on their muscle
			memory of patterns practised and perfected
			over years. You can learn them too. First assign
			numbers to your fingers and thumbs. Thumbs are always one. Index fingers two. Middle
			fingers three and so on. Notice how the hands
			and numbers are mirror images of each other.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Play this major scale ascending and
			descending on a loop, paying close attention to
			the finger pattern, as it’s this pattern which will
			enable you to make the scale (and in time the beautiful melody you’re going to write) sound
			smooth. Aim for even delivery rather than
			quickly rushing through.</p>

			<ul class="font-size-body-text custom-ol">
				<li>Once you’ve got the hang of it try playing
				your scale as quarter notes, along to the
				second hand of the clock (60bpm).</li>
				<li>Then try quarter notes at 120bpm. (That’s
				two notes to every second of the clock).</li>
				<li>Finally, can you repeat with quarter notes
				at 240bpm? (That’s four notes to every
				second of the clock).</li>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">⧗ Now without any specific tempo or rhythm,
			improvise with the notes of your major key
			all over the piano for one minute. When you’re
			confident playing in the lower, middle and
			higher registers, bring in your rhythmic phrase
			from Day Two (the four bar phrase on your
			worksheet), setting the pulse at 60bpm. Using
			the notes of your major key still, loop your
			rhythmic phrase, experimenting with different
			combinations of notes each time. Here’s a little
			inspiration for you...</p>

			<ul class="font-size-body-text custom-ol">
				<li>Start with single notes in your left and
				right hand, before playing two or more
				notes together.</li>
				<li>Try starting in a high register and slowly
				descend as you improvise, before
				ascending again to end the minute.</li>
				<li>Try putting your hands at either end of the piano and work towards the middle,
				then back out again.</li>
				<li>Try playing root notes in a low register
				with your left hand (LH) while your RH
				moves around freely. Can you manage
				two root notes an octave apart with
				your LH?</li>
