			<p class="font-size-body-text">‘You’ve got to be joking’ she said, not so much a
			question as a statement, as she opened the living
			room door and clocked the shiny six foot bass
			obstructing the feature wall. ‘It’s sexy...’ I offered
			up, ‘...it brings the room to life!’ Commentary on
			home style never failed to rile Hayley up. I had
			a knack for delivering it right after she’d spent
			an hour reorganising a shelf, changing it up to
			include ‘more negative space’ between the books
			and trinkets. ‘Ben, you can’t play the bass?’ Now
			this one was a question, she was genuinely
			confused. The answer was obvious. ‘I’ll learn’.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">As a self-taught drummer and pianist, the
			prospect of learning something new never
			phases me. The only thing standing between
			me and my vision of delivering a smooth, jazzy
			bass line was a steady stream of work. Accept
			that fact and the rest is not so bad. I grabbed
			the bass and walked it up the garden path. A
			few minutes later I’d succeeded in squeezing
			it through the music room doors, <em>double</em> doors
			may I add. I marvelled at my new companion
			and it’s autumn coloured glow. I especially
			loved the snail shell at the top, carved from a
			fist of wood that held on tightly to the strings.
			I noticed how close it all was to the ceiling, and
			remembered this bass was on loan.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Over the weeks that followed I tried my hand
			at writing and playing simple parts. Some days
			I’d notice heat in my fingertips, a rawness setting in, and I’d stop and take a break. Other
			days I ignored the tingling sensation, and paid
			the price in blisters all that night. Gradually
			the positions of many different notes became
			second nature; that and I got better at bending
			them in tune whenever I initially missed the
			mark. I challenged myself to finish writing one
			of the pieces I had on the go for voice, keys
			and bass. Then I got a phone call from a friend
			who was putting on a gig online, an evening of
			music to raise money for the NHS. It was the
			second national lockdown since the outbreak
			of Covid-19. Could my piece be ready in time?</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">I twisted Hayley’s arm. The whole thing made
			her nervous but she let me sign us up; a
			duo with Hayley on voice and keys, and my
			debut on bass. Practice was a tense affair.
			Hayley’s a perfectionist and I was still off-
			key, yet somehow I was sure I’d get there by
			the night. Deadlines are the rocket fuel we
			sometimes need, I truly believe this. One time
			running through, I noticed how patterns I’d
			ingrained over years spent playing drums were
			influencing my bass lines. Bubbling, driving
			rhythms baked into my tissues came flowing
			through the hourglass shaped box. It was this
			moment that birthed my spirited enquiry into
			multi-instrumentalism, essays on the theme,
			and the rapid expansion of my instrument
			collection - across every room in the house.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">On the night of the gig we moved a sweetheart
			plant from the bathroom to the music room,
			followed by a yukka and a palm. Next we shook
			the pretty woven rug and moved it into view,
			took our seats and counted ourselves in: ‘one’,
			‘two’, silent three and four. At the end of our
			performance Hayley smiled and I watched her
			shoulders drop an inch or two. We waved into
			the camera and registered the clapping coming
			through back at us. Afterwards my stepdad
			sent a text, a few short lines in praise of my
			technique. It took me by surprise, he’s a tough
			nut to crack. I popped a nice prosecco, caught
			the cork and marked it with the date. ‘Let’s
			treat ourselves...’ said Hayley, ‘...that went well!’
			My thoughts began to wander, minutes passed.
			Something about a vase and post-pandemic
			spa day drifted through the air between us. ‘I’ve
			got it!’ I proclaimed. ‘Let’s buy a xaphoon.’</p>
