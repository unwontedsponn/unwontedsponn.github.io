			<h1><span class="chap_num">Day 6: Take The A Train</span>
				Creating the A section of your composition
			</h1>

			<p class="font-size-body-text"><span class="bold">ABA form</span><br>
			Somewhere Over The Rainbow and Great Balls
			Of Fire. What on earth could these two songs
			have in common? The answer is their form. Many
			compositions are underpinned by a structure
			we call the ABA form. A and B are the names of
			sections. The underlying chord progression of
			the A sections always remains the same. If the A
			section is in a major key, which it often is, the B
			section might move to a minor key to keep things
			interesting. (We’ll get to minor keys tomorrow).
			The B section typically introduces a new melody,
			another way to reinforce the new mood created
			by the minor key.</p>

			<div class="pop_up_box"><span class="bold">Long and winding road</span><br>
				<p class="font-size-body-text">The Beatles liked to extend the classic
				ABA form to keep the excitement
				going for longer. Hey Jude. I Want to
				Hold Your Hand. Hard Day’s Night. All
				these songs are structured AABABA.
				Can you think of any other Beatles
				records that progress in this way?</p>
			</div>
		
			<p class="font-size-body-text"><span class="bold">Exploring the A section</span><br>
			I want you to explore an A section in the major
			key you’ve already set for your composition.
			You could move around the major key circle
			from the last lesson, that would be perfectly
			acceptable. However there are more options for
			your sequences of chords beyond the basics of
			the musical circle, more creative possibilities, all
			of which are captured here for you.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">The beauty of this diagram is that you can
			start on any of the roman numerals, on any of
			the chords. From there you simply follow the
			arrows to determine what comes next. The viio
			chord only has one arrow moving it forward.
			That means there’s only one chord that will
			sound right after viio and that’s I. All the other
			chords though can move forward in at least
			two different ways, like vim can move to IV or
			iim, and V to I or vim.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">The I is special. From here you can move to
			any other chord. It’s also the best chord to
			bring things to a close, to make things sound
			finished and complete. This is because the I
			chord is your root, the key you are playing in. In
			other words, it’s like coming home.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">⧗ You could move endlessly around the chords
			in the diagram, but I’m going to ask you to
			improvise for just one minute. Remember you
			can start on any of the chords, and when you’re
			ready to bring things to a close move to the I
			and stay there. You might like to try:</p>

			<ul class="font-size-body-text custom-ol">
				<li>Playing with one hand only (RH or LH).</li>
				<li>Playing HT.</li>
				<li>Using one rhythmic value for each chord
				(eg. half notes).</li>
				<li>Switching between rhythmic values as
				you move between chords (e.g. whole and
				half notes).</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">By now you will have found many beautiful
			chord progressions. Write your favourite four
			bar progression on your worksheet, write in
			the A section.</p>

			<ul class="font-size-body-text custom-ol">
				<li>Improvise with the chord tones of
				your chord progression, the individual
				notes that make up your chords. Use
				both hands all over the piano. Improvise
				without any specific rhythm or pulse
				restricting you. Be free.</li>
				<li>Now play your chord tones to the
				rhythmic phrase written on your
				worksheet, still using both hands.
				Steadily work towards a pulse.</li>
				<li>Can you play the last step using
				only your RH?</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="font-size-body-text"><span class="bold">Time to choose: </span>With your LH, play your chord
			progression, as chords this time, not individual
			chord tones. Choose a rhythmic value for your
			LH e.g. half notes. Whatever value you choose,
			the chord change should always fall on beat
			one. Meanwhile your RH is going to play the
			chord tones that correspond with each LH
			chord, set to the rhythmic phrase on your worksheet. Challenging? It will be. Now try this:</p>

			<ul class="font-size-body-text custom-ol">
				<li>Keep your LH in a really low register.</li>
				<li>Move your RH all over the piano, even
				down to the lower registers.</li>
				<li>Experiment with the sustain pedal
				(under your right foot).</li>
				<li>Now choose a different rhythmic value
				for your LH and repeat this exercise.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Draw on the moments of your improvisation
			that you enjoyed the most to create a short
			excerpt. Something memorable that you
			can repeat. Practise your excerpt until it’s
			committed to memory and you can play it
			perfectly. Perform it, to a real person this time,
			not just to the cat. It’s never too soon to start
			composing and playing for others.</p>
