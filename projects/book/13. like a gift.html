			<p class="font-size-body-text">Rivulets of rain gather, burst and race down the
			window of my studio. Outside my neighbour’s cat
			shoots across the glossy green lawn, desperate
			to get out of the wet. A week ago, sitting in this
			same spot, I’d been noodling at the keys when a
			piano part arrived; landed fully formed and quite
			complete, like it had always existed - simply
			elsewhere. In the days that followed I explored
			it, adding this and changing that, but for the
			most part kept returning to the way it tumbled
			out the first time around. I decided to record
			it, not a perfect take but good enough to play
			along to on my double bass and drums. Again the
			parts appeared to write themselves, no force or
			labouring required. It felt a bit like cheating.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Not every composition goes like this. It’s
			special when it does, like a gift. All you have to
			do is show up to receive it. As the music comes
			through I get the sense that time does not
			exist. This is something I have heard, but now
			I feel it; like embodying the past, present and
			future all at once. It leaves me feeling high the
			whole week long. Light, like walking on air.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Anyone that tries enough times to create
			something will eventually get an experience like
			this. I liken it to falling in love, only with something
			you can’t see, touch or fully understand. I score
			the final bars and see the whites out on the line
			begin to drip. A blouse slides through the pegs and
			slaps the ground. The encounter is over.</p>
