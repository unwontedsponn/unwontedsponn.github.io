			<p class="font-size-body-text">Hello, I’m Ben and I want to open this book by
			telling you why I wrote it. As a boy I decided I
			wanted to become a musician. No-one else in
			my family played an instrument and I had no
			access to music lessons, but for some reason
			I answered the call. I saved my wages and
			treated myself to table top drum pads. Then
			hounded my Mum for another few years, until
			one very special teenage birthday when a drum
			kit appeared, glowing in our front room. My idol
			then was Sid Vicious, naturally for an aspiring
			high school punk, which gives you an idea what
			my Mum was letting herself in for. I have fond
			memories of that time, of the bands I formed
			with friends, of the garage we’d rehearse in. What
			we lacked in skill we made up for with passion,
			and the unbridled creativity that flows from
			teenage pores. We were rock stars. Somerset’s
			finest, perhaps, known only to each other.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Fast-forward to my twenties, to London, where
			I found myself slogging away in a factory, in a
			post room and as a chef in a busy cafe. It was
			the recession and despite having a degree
			in music it was hard to find work. In one of
			those roles I led a strike, ever the anarchist. My
			colleagues and I wanted minimum wage, not
			an unreasonable request, but it didn’t end well.
			It’s a bit of a blur but I have it on good record
			the boss held scissors to my neck. Needless to
			say, change was in the air. I was desperate to escape the grind, 
			to work for someone I looked up to, or failing that work for myself. 
			I was a drummer, not the greatest, but there was an
			idea at least. I could get better. I moved in with
			my sister, commandeered the living room in our
			one bed flat above The Salisbury pub on Green
			Lanes. Splitting the rent with her meant I could
			quit one of my three jobs. No prizes for guessing
			which one. I used my newly reclaimed time to
			practice, practice, and practice some more.
			</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">It probably looked a bit like obsession, but
			it was a lifeline. A vehicle for my faith in a
			bigger, better life. In truth it wasn’t just the
			crap jobs and sticky finances that had got me
			down. There’d been trauma in my childhood,
			somewhere between the gigs and good times,
			and the shockwaves were still reverberating
			through me. Releasing those tremors through
			cymbals and skins was catharsis. My kit,
			my daily conversation with it, gave voice to
			experiences that had never before found
			words. Then a neighbour complained. I could
			hardly blame them, and I took the kit down.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">I decided to buy a keyboard (and a set of
			headphones). I’d been curious to learn the
			piano for years but overnight it had become
			essential. Having already taught myself the
			drums I knew I could teach myself the piano,
			and yet navigating the sea of information
			proved tricky. Books for beginners tended to
			be aimed at kids, meanwhile books for adults 
			assumed prior knowledge that I didn’t have -
			so many technical and theoretical terms. The
			thing that kept me going was curiosity. Not so
			much curiosity in the concepts themselves,
			but in how I could apply them. I’m a creative
			person (I believe we all are) and the act
			of composing my own music has always
			been what’s spurred me on to acquire more
			theoretical know-how. Just as I’d previously
			played around on the drums, I would now sit
			and noodle on the piano, allowing interesting
			patterns and melodies to unfold, and turning
			them into pieces.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">There’s a magic to composing. It’s surprising
			what’s inside of you, surprising to hear it
			transmuted into rhythm and song. It can
			surprise others too. My partner has both laughed
			and cried at pieces I’ve created, at my riotous
			basslines and haunting musical reportage. It was
			essential for me that any book I wrote about
			learning an instrument emphasised the act of
			tuning inwards, of experimenting intuitively with
			what you find there, and channelling it through
			the keys. I want others to experience the thrill of
			direct contact with their innate creative nature,
			to become curious about what they could
			manifest, whether that’s a ten second riff, a pop
			song or a symphony. Since writing this book I’ve
			learned that curiosity is in fact scientifically
			proven to enhance learning. It sounds like
			common sense and yet it’s uncommon to find 
			educational programmes that put curiosity
			front and centre where it belongs. In 2001,
			researchers Alberti and Witryol found a positive
			correlation between curiosity and intellectual
			performance among students completing a
			laboratory task. They also identified a positive
			relationship between the students’ intellectual
			performance and the curiosity of their teacher.
			Curiosity is infectious it seems, but I digress...</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Back at my flat, between shifts at the factory
			and the cafe, I was gradually getting the hang
			of the keyboard. With hindsight, this was also
			the period I learned discipline, how to take
			responsibility for myself and my prospects.
			When I listen to how other people talk about
			their lives I can always tell whether they’ve
			had that realisation yet or not, the one that
			goes ‘I’m in charge here’, ‘I decide the quality of
			my life’. When I sense that someone has that
			lesson still to come, I can’t help but wax lyrical
			about the benefits of self-tuition - the act of
			helping oneself - in any field of study or area of
			life. I get fanatical imparting pearls of wisdom:
			the confidence they’ll gain, the empowerment
			they’ll feel. No-one needs to suffer life and
			when that penny finally drops, you’re free. I tell
			that to anyone who’ll listen.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Writing this today I’m a drum and piano tutor,
			teaching all styles from classical and jazz to
			rock and pop. I’m also an examiner for music 
			boards like RSL and Yamaha, and a composer
			creating original material across a range of
			projects. On the performance side, I’ve had
			the privilege of touring the UK with a number
			of bands and artists, immersing myself in a
			wide range of genres including hip-hop, folk
			and contemporary jazz. I’ve come a long way
			since my days in the factory, but my reason for
			writing this book is not to lay the foundations
			for your satisfying musical career. Indeed many
			of my readers are adults, already invested in
			work of a very different nature. Instead I want
			to persuade you that playing an instrument is
			a life enhancing gift you give to yourself, and
			that following your own curiosity and creative
			impulses is the fastest, most enjoyable way
			to progress. An instrument is a way to meet
			people, like the dear friend I got to know
			through playing together in a band, or my
			partner who I first met at an audition. It’s a
			way to relax, a form of meditation to shake
			off the day and connect more deeply with
			yourself. It’s also a vehicle for expression, a
			medium of communication from one heart to
			another, a dialogue from soul to soul. Music is
			a metamorphosis of the raw stuff of human
			experience. Since we’re all human, we can all
			create something beautiful. If you’re lucky, you
			could create something sublime.</p>
			
			<p class="font-size-body-text">So there you have it. The benefits of learning
			an instrument are just too damn good to be 
			bestowed exclusively on the young, and despite
			what you may think it’s not too late to start
			now, whatever age you happen to be. So what
			are you waiting for? Give yourself the gift of
			learning the piano, starting today. I also urge
			you not to wait until you’re ‘good’ to start
			experimenting with your own musical ideas.
			In fact this book won’t let you, you’ll have your
			own composition in just fourteen days. Adults
			are terrible perfectionists, painfully aware
			when we sound bad and comically prone to
			comparing ourselves with the greats (even
			on our first go at making music). ‘An expert...’
			says Nobel Prize winner Niels Bohr, ‘...is a man
			who has made all the mistakes which can
			be made in a narrow field’. I wholeheartedly
			agree. Accidents have led to some of the most
			original and innovative compositions out there,
			so first and foremost approach this book with
			the intention to have a good time. Making good
			music will naturally follow, I’ve no doubt.</p>
