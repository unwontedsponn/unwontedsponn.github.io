			<p class="font-size-body-text">It’s the year 2000 and I have not long been ten.
			Around me in a horseshoe are cushions, lifted
			from all corners of the house. The best one is
			the taffeta, the snare. It makes a satisfying ‘dat’
			when I hit it with my sticks. For toms I have
			curated harder toys and books, overlaid with
			tea towels for a better kind of ‘bom’. Knowing
			I’d get told to turn it down, I savour the brilliant
			opening bars of the chorus of Heart Shaped
			Box. I thrash along wildly. If I go loud enough
			I can say ‘I didn’t hear you’ when my Mum
			inevitably appears, and she might just believe
			me. I played like this for years, perfecting the
			lay out of my ‘kit’ by studying my favourite
			drummers on TV.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">At fourteen I saved the wages from my paper-round and upgraded to slick, black table-top pads. My mates and I decided it was time to
			gig and chose Oh Yeah by The Subways to
			perform to the school. Tom on guitar, Matt on
			vocals, and Jim on bass. We crossed the stage
			like gods. I was on the kit, a real one this time,
			which it quickly transpired felt nothing like
			the rubber practice pads I was used to. I can
			still remember the name of our band. It was
			the stuff of teenage brains, a string of words
			inspired by an ever-present impulse to offend.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Fast-forward to my twenties, a new band and
			an audience of eight-hundred people moving
			to our music in the sun. In the run up to the gig we had rehearsed like crazy and it showed.
			At the front was Ahmar, singing and bouncing
			around with waist-length dreads that at high
			points he’d let loose and send flying across
			the stage. To his left, Mensah, a London rapper,
			all street slang and swag. To his right, Missy,
			petite but powerful with a thick Edinburgh
			accent, taking care of the high notes. Behind
			this dynamic trio was me and the rest of the
			rhythm section.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">For all our differences in looks and
			performance style, this was a band with
			serious rapport. The climax of the gig came
			after several minutes of high intensity hip-
			hop rock. Missy and the two guys busted out
			a dance sequence, expertly choreographed to
			hype the fans. Suddenly the routine would stop,
			synced perfectly with the most epic crash of
			the cymbals I could muster. A brief moment of
			silence followed and then Missy would begin
			to rap. No one in the audience ever saw it
			coming, and there was something about this
			tiny blonde Scot’s rhymes that sent the crowd
			absolutely loopy every time.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">From the stage I could see them all. Some
			were fans we recognised, others were new.
			Everyone was present in the moment, united
			in the music and aliveness of it all. There’s
			a symbiotic relationship between band and
			audience, both feed off each other to create an energy unique to each gig. You become part of
			something bigger than yourself. Euphoria. Any
			festival goer will know the feeling. I remember
			getting close to it in my garage at fourteen. We
			were the epicentre of Ilminster, my buddies & I.
			The sensation at the festival was the same, only
			amplified. Nothing else existed but our bodies in
			the sound and our hearts inside the beat.</p>
