			<h1><span class="chap_num">Day 5: Can You Hear Me Major Tom?</span>
				The major key circle
			</h1>

			<p class="font-size-body-text"><span class="bold">Strong chord movements</span><br>
			Last lesson you learned that different chords
			belong to different keys and identified the chords
			that belong to the key that’s on your worksheet.
			Now you’re going to find out the strongest way to
			move between these chords, the best sequences
			to make your chords sound musical. This is
			where the major key circle comes in.</p>

			Wherever you start on this circle, move to the next
			chord (clockwise or anti-clockwise) to create the most natural sounding chord progression. Moving
			clockwise gives the impression of a sunrise, a
			feeling of opening. Moving anti-clockwise is
			more like a sunset, an ending.</p>

			Fill in the circle on your worksheet with the
			chords that belong to your chosen key.</p>

			<ul class="font-size-body-text custom-ol">
				<li>Use your RH to play the chords as whole
				notes, anticlockwise all the way round the
				circle. Start and finish with the root chord.</li>
				<li>Now use your LH.</li>
				<li>Now try playing the major scale written
				on your worksheet with your RH while you
				keep the LH chords going (whole notes).
				Play the scale with the finger pattern and
				as quarter notes, twice through. That’s
				ascending and descending, without pausing at the top or bottom, or hitting the same
				note twice. When you play the scale twice
				through like this, it gives you the perfect
				amount of time to cover all the chords on
				the major key circle with your LH - starting
				and finishing with the root chord.</li>
				<li>Practise this exercise until you can play it
				on a continuous loop with no mistakes, to
				a steady pulse like 60bpm or 120bpm. You
				know you’ve really got it down when you
				can play it and hold a conversation. Go on,
				give it a go.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">
			Students always love this exercise. It’s satisfying
			to play, but more than that, it gives you a glimpse
			behind the composer’s curtain. It reveals the
			underlying chord movements, the enchanting
			alchemy that makes music sound musical.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text"><span class="bold">Time to choose: </span>It’s time to up the ante. Select
			a new rhythm for your LH chords as they move
			around the major key circle e.g. half notes like in
			the table below. Then select a new rhythm for your
			RH scale e.g. quarter notes, which you’ll continue
			to play using the finger pattern. There are quite a
			few different combinations that you could choose,
			so this should be interesting! Remember, change
			chord every four beats no matter what rhythms
			you’ve rolled. You could think of it like changing
			chord at the start of every bar. Practise until you
			can keep a steady pulse of 60bpm.</p>

			<table class="main-table fixed-table-layout">
				<thead class="orange">
					<tr>
						<th>LH CHORD RHYTHM</th>
						<th>RH SCALE RHYTHM</th>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">⧗ Now it’s time to start training your ear to
			hear which notes of the key sound best over
			your LH chords, which you’re going to play now
			as whole notes for one minute. Meanwhile, use
			your RH to improvise with <em>any of the notes</em> of
			your chosen key. You can use <em>any rhythm</em> you
			like for your RH notes, I want you to feel really
			free as you explore. Create short phrases. In
			music, a phrase is a short section that forms
			part of a bigger whole. You can liken it to a
			short section that forms part of a sentence,
			like in the example below. End each of your
			phrases with a chord tone, a note that is also
			in your LH chord, to help each phrase sound
			complete and rounded.</p>
